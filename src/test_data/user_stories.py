    As a user
    I want to securely enter my email and password in the login form
    So that I can authenticate and gain access to the system
    URL: https://wm-trucking-web.tekstagearea.com/
    Expected behavior:
    - The email field should validate input to ensure a proper email format
    - The password field should mask input for security
    - The "Sign In" button should remain disabled until both fields are filled correctly
    - Upon successful authentication, redirect the user to the dashboard

    Valid Email:  super_admin@yopmail.com
    Valid Password:  Admin@123
